Java Core Concepts – Revision Notes
Today I revised some important Java fundamentals. Writing them down here to keep track and also help anyone who’s learning like me.

What is Java?
Java is a high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent language. It follows the “write once, run anywhere” concept because of the JVM.

Features of Java:
Simple – easy to learn
Object-Oriented – everything is based on objects
Platform Independent – code runs anywhere with JVM
Secure – has built-in security features
Robust – handles memory and exceptions well
Multithreaded – can do many tasks at once
Portable – runs on different platforms without changes
High Performance – due to JIT compiler
Distributed – supports distributed systems using RMI and EJB
Dynamic – loads classes at runtime

JVM, JRE, JDK:
JVM: Executes Java bytecode
JRE: JVM + libraries (to run Java apps)
JDK: JRE + tools like compiler (to write and run Java programs)

Variables in Java: are used to store the data
Local variable – inside a method/block
Instance variable – inside class, outside method, belongs to object
Static variable – with static keyword, belongs to class, shared by all objects

Data Types: Datatypes in java specify the type of data a variable can hold
Primitive – byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean
Non-primitive – String, Arrays, Classes, etc.

Literals:
Fixed values assigned directly to variables like 10, 3.14, 'A', true

Operators: operators in java are special symbols used to perform operations on variables and values
Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %
Assignment: =, +=, -=,*=, /=, %= 
Unary: ++, --, !
Relational: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
Logical: &&, ||
Bitwise: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>
Ternary: condition ? true : false

Type Casting:
There are two types
Implicit(Widening) – small to big type (e.g., int to float)(automatically)
Explicit(Narrowing) – big to small type, done manually (e.g., (int) 3.5)
